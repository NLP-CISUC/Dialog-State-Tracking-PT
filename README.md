# MultiWOZpt
Portuguese Dialogue Corpus Adapted from MultiWOZ Dataset 2.2

The creation of the MultiWOZpt 0.1 dataset (the first version) was based on the manual adaptation and translation of the 512 test dialogues present in the English MultiWOZ dataset. These dialogues include five services, namely:
+ Attractions
+ Hotels
+ Restaurants
+ Taxis
+ Trains
  
The translation involved converting the sentences uttered by the User and System into Portuguese. 

The adaptation part encompassed adjusting the five Cambridge services present in the test dialogues to align with the existing services in Coimbra. These adapted services can be found in the created database(DataBase - Services), which contains the following files: "attractionsCoimbra_db.json", "hotelsCoimbra_db.json", "restaurantsCoimbra_db.json", and "trainsCoimbra_db.json".
